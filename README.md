# Speller
A program in C that spell-checks a file, a la the below, using a hash table.

How to check whether your program is outting the right misspelled words? Well, you’re welcome to consult the “answer keys” that are inside of the keys directory that’s inside of your speller directory. For instance, inside of keys/lalaland.txt are all of the words that your program should think are misspelled.

You could therefore run your program on some text in one window, as with the below.

$ ./speller texts/lalaland.txt
